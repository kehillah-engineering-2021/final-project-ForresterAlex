# README final project
## Description of Project: 

This project is to create what is essentially a 'high capacity' cassete tape, able to fit into existing players, but provide a much longer run time than your standard 90 minute tape. The motivation for a.... questionably useful project is a friend of mine who likes things from the 80s. I don't ask question, I do things. 

## Goals of Project:

### Main Objectives
- fit into existing tape players with little to no modification
- operate for a reasonable amount of time before battery things happen
- fit more than 90 minutes of music
- pause/play

### Other Objectives
- rewind, fast forward, stop functions
- emulate cassete behaviour instead of modern digital player
